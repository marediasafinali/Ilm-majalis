            content: `<p>In the Name of God the Compassionate, the Merciful.</p><p>1. Listen to the reed how it tells a tale, complaining of separations !</p><p>2. Saying, “Ever since I was parted from the reed-bed, my lament hath caused man and woman to moan.</p><p>3. I want a bosom torn by severance, that I may unfold (to such a one) the pain of love-desire.</p><p>4. Every one who is left far from his source wishes back the time when he was united with it.</p><p>8. None is permitted to see (by physical eyes) the soul.</p><p>9. This noise of the reed is fire, it is not wind: whoso hath not this fire, may he be naught!</p><p>11. The reed is the comrade of every one who has been parted from a friend: its strains pierced our hearts.</p><p>13. reed tells of the Way full of blood and recounts stories of the passion of Majnún.</p><p>14. Only to the senseless is this sense confided.</p><p>15. In our woe the days (of life) have become untimely: our days travel hand in hand with burning griefs.</p><p>16. If our days are gone, let them go!—’tis no matter. Do Thou remain, for none is holy as Thou art!</p><p>17. Whoever is not a fish becomes sated with His water; whoever is without daily bread finds the day long.</p><p>18. None that is raw understands the state of the ripe: therefore my words must be brief. Farewell!</p><p>19. O son, burst thy chains and be free! How long wilt thou be a bondsman to silver and gold?</p><p>22. He (alone) whose garment is rent by a (mighty) love is purged of covetousness and all defect.</p><p>23. Hail, O Love that bringest us good gain—thou that art the physician of all our ills.</p><p>24. The remedy of our pride and vainglory, our Plato and our Galen!</p><p>25. Through Love the earthly body soared to the skies: the mountain began to dance and became nimble.</p><p>26. Love inspired Mount Sinai, O lover, (so that) Sinai (was made) drunken and Moses fell in a swoon.</p><p>30. The Beloved is all and the lover (but) a veil; the Beloved is living and the lover a dead thing.</p><p>31. When Love hath no care for him, he is left as a bird without wings. Alas for him then!</p><p>32. How should I have consciousness (of aught) before or behind when the light of my Beloved is not before me and behind?</p><p>33. Love wills that this Word should be shown forth: if the mirror does not reflect, how is that?</p><p>34. Dost thou know why the mirror (of thy soul) reflects nothing? Because the rust is not cleared from its face.</p>`,
